									<h2>Design Brief</h2>
									<p>In this project I was required to design and create a windpowered vehicle. It was to be powered by the force of wind as the final source of movement. There were no batteries allowed to be used at all in the product. It was to have a maximum width of 200mm and length of 300mm.
									I also had to hand in this folio of everything I did and my thought process.</p>

									<h2>Research Idea 1</h2>
										<p> In this design the body is weak structurally but is also light making it move more with less force. It used the rubber band to wind up a propeller on the back of the vehicle which makes it move. The tension from the rubber band after being twisted causes the propeller to spin forcing the wind to push behind the vehicle making it move forward especially because it is very light weight it will go with more ease and further. They use a skewer and poked it through the bottle with bottle caps that are designed to be the wheels. This works well because there is a low resistance between the skewer and the plastic on the bottle causing it to spin well.</p>

									<h2>Research Idea 2</h2>
									<p>Again in this design a plastic bottle is being used mainly because it is light making it move easier. In this design a straw has been placed inside of the bottle with a skewer going through it to create a smooth and loose turn of the wheels which are again bottle caps attached to the end of a skewer. A balloon is tied around a straw with an elastic band. When the balloon is blown up the pressure of the wind it stronger through the straw causing it to push the vehicle forward with more efficiency and control of the wind.</p>

																<h2>Research Idea 3</h2>
																<p>This design uses a rectangle paper bowl to hold together the wheel structure. The wheel structure is a disc being stabilised by two bottle caps with a skewer between them tightly holding the disc in place not causing it to rotate on an angle slightly. On top of that the paper plate it is used as a wind sail, it collects the winds force and pushes the vehicle forwards with a lot of force because of the large surface on the paper plate. This whole concept works well because it is all extremely light weight and doesn’t rely on its own creation of wind. It uses real wind instead of its own making it reliable to work but if there is no wind or little wind it will struggle to move and will not work very effectively.</p>

							<h2>Main Idea</h2>
							<p>I plan to create a thin and light plywood base. Attach a straw to the ends of the plywood and fit a skewer in the straw; and poke skewer ends into bottle caps to be used as wheels.
								Possibly craft a small ramp so the balloon doesn’t make contact with the wheels. Tape a straw around the inside of the mouth piece of the balloon. Attach straw facing backwards for forward momentum.</p>
								<h2>Alternative Idea</h2>
								<p>Another Idea I have is to use a water bottle (600ml) to replace the plywood from previous idea.
									The pros of doing this is that I will not have to risk getting the wrong measurements on the plywood and it will be a lot lighter.
									The cons is that it might not have enough weight to give a straight forward momentum, hypothetically. Everything else would remain the same.</p>

									<h3>Materials & Uses</h3>
									<p>•	Plywood, I used plywood because it is light, structurally strong and was something easily accessible to me through school supplies.<br>
										•	Straws, the straws are going to be used as a chamber to hold skewers which will turn inside of the straw loosely providing little resistance between the two. One will also be used to create pressurised air for the balloon.<br>
										•	Skewers, these would be attached to the wheels and rotates inside of the straw being held in one spot loosely so it can turn freely.<br>
										•	Balloon, the balloon is going to be used to hold the source of wind that is required for my wind powered vehicle to work.<br>
										•	Duct tape, this will hold down the wheel axels and the straw attached to the balloon.<br>
										•	Bottle caps, I used bottle caps to be used as wheels when attached to the skewers and rotate when the pressure from the balloon is released.</p>

									<h3>Material Sustainability</h3>
									<p>Plywood –<br>
										<br>FSC: The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is the only certification scheme on the market that guarantees timber products that come from legal and responsibly managed sources. Wood labelled by the FSC comes from forests or plantations that are well managed according to strict environmentally and socially responsible standards.
										<br>OSB: Oriented Strand Board (OSB) is a composite wood product made from layers of wood bonded with wax and resin adhesives. FSC certified OSB is a greener alternative to tropical plywood and is priced competitively. It is no different from plywood in terms of its quality and workability.
										<br>FSC certified plywood: Plywood that is certified by the FSC indicates that it is made from sustainable sources and does not come from endangered tropical rainforests or illegal sources. It can be used in places where OSB is not available or practical

									<h3>Soft Plywood</h3>
									<p>Softwood panel is usually made either of cedar, Douglas fir or spruce, pine, and fir (collectively known as spruce-pine-fir or SPF) or redwood and is typically used for construction and industrial purposes.
										The most common dimension is 1.2 by 2.4 metres (3 ft 11 in × 7 ft 10 in) or the slightly larger imperial dimension of 4 feet × 8 feet. Plies vary in thickness from 1.4 mm to 4.3 mm. The number of plies—which is always odd—depends on the thickness and grade of the sheet. Roofing can use the thinner 5/8" (15 mm) plywood. Subfloors are at least 3/4" (18 mm) thick, the thickness depending on the distance between floor joists. Plywood for flooring applications is often tongue and groove; this prevents one board from moving up or down relative to its neighbour, so providing a solid-feeling floor when the joints do not lie over joists. T&G plywood is usually found in the 1/2" to 1" (12–25 mm) range.

									<h3>Hard Plywood	</h3>
									<p>Hardwood plywood is made out of wood from angiosperm trees and used for demanding end uses. Hardwood plywood is characterized by its excellent strength, stiffness and resistance to creep. It has a high planar shear strength and impact resistance, which make it especially suitable for heavy-duty floor and wall structures. Oriented plywood construction has a high wheel-carrying capacity. Hardwood plywood has excellent surface hardness, and damage- and wear-resistance.
										<br><h3>Tools Used</h3>I used the scroll saw to cut out the plywood base I had previously designed.
										I used a file to sand down the edges to the margins that I missed when cutting out my base.
										Scissors were used to cut the straws and skewers.
										Sandpaper, I used this to smoothen the edges and reduce the risk of getting a splinter.

									<h2>Week 1</h2>
									<p>Begin research of various different ideas for our wind powered vehicle.
										I went onto the internet and began researching different ways wind can power something in a kinetic way. I learned that I could use a clockwork design but it was a lot of work and would be heavy probably ending up in not enough work to even begin moving the vehicle because of the weight from the clockwork design.
										I looked into a way to ‘kick-start’ a small electrical motor using kinetic energy and have the motor power a propeller on the back to create motion of wind and move it forwards. I also did not like this design idea because it was difficult to work a way to “kick-start” an electric motor without actual electricity.
										I found later that day after looking through various different designs that I could use a balloon to store the wind and pressurise it on its way out creating a large enough force to push the vehicle forwards with only the use of wind.</p>

									<h2>Week 2</h2>
									<p>In week 2 I began researching what materials I could use for this design to maximise the amount of force I get from the balloon. I looked at weight mainly because wind can only push out so much force. I also had to focus on wheel spin also so there is even more efficiency.
										After picking out my materials I began to draw out a draft of what I would like it to look like and annotate it.
										This would give me a good idea of what could possibly go wrong and what will work well. It also gives me room to look at modifying certain parts and elements of it early and testing what works more efficiently.</p>

											<h2>Week 4</h2>
											<p>I began getting the right measurements for my plywood base. I drew the measurements I eventually decided on onto the plywood. I then began cutting out the plywood base and worked on my folio and book work a little bit. I had trouble getting my measurements to be symmetrical the way I wanted it to be but eventually got there due to determination.</p>

												<h2>Week 5</h2>
												<p>This week I finished cutting out the base and filed the corners to reduce how sharp they were. I also filed the sides and edges to make sure that every side was the same length in measurement I originally chose. The base is a very important component because it is the whole structure of the vehicle, it determines if it goes straight, holds all the pieces without breaking and needs to keep everything connected in order for it to work. I filed the edges slightly too hard and cracked a few of the sides in the middle, this did not weaken the light plywood base luckily.</p>

												<h2>Week 6</h2>
												<p>This week we unfortunately had a substitute teacher meaning we couldn’t get any of our practical work done. We were told to do pages 0-82 in our systems engineering textbook for the three periods Forbes was away. Unfortunately we actually only got 2 periods to do this practice for our first SAC in systems due to a school swimming carnival that was compulsory to attend.</p>

												<h2>Week 7</h2>
												<p>In week 7 I sanded the edges to be smooth and reduce the risk of splinters. I then went on to measuring out how far I wanted the straws on the bottom of the chassis to poke out and the length of the skewer I needed to reach both ends with enough room to stab the bottle cap through. At this point in time my project was going well and I could definitely see that it was all going to plan, hoping it would work in the end. I lost a period do work on my project this week due to a systems engineering SAC.</p>

												<h2>Week 8</h2>
												<p>This week I was nearly done with my project. I taped the mouth piece of a balloon around a straw and tied it down to the base with the other end of the straw facing off the edge so I could blow it up still. With the wheel axel points in place and source of force from the balloon already completed all I had to do now was attach my wheels. I could work on the rest of my folio and catch up with what I have done recently. Forbes also asked to see my folio but showed no interest to anything other than the first two pages being the cover page and the index page, he did not look at the research page, design page, constraints page, drafts, materials page making it hard to show him that I have put in the effort required for a pass this unit.</p>
