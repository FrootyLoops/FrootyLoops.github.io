							<strong><p>Electric Motors:<br></strong>
						An electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The reverse of this is the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator.
						A commutated electrically excited series or parallel wound motor is referred to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power.<br><br>
						<strong>AC Power –</strong><br>
							AC power is alternating current, so when the electrical current changes direction periodically.<br>
							<strong>DC Power –</strong> <br>
							It is an electrical current that can only flow in one direction.</p>
							<br><strong><h3>Forklifts -</h3></strong><br>
							<p>Forklifts are rated for loads at a specified maximum weight and a specified forward centre of gravity. This information is located on a nameplate provided by the manufacturer, and loads must not exceed these specifications. In many jurisdictions it is illegal to alter or remove the nameplate without the permission of the forklift manufacturer.
							An important aspect of forklift operation is that it must have rear-wheel steering. While this increases manoeuvrability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver’s traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. While steering, as there is no caster action, it is unnecessary to apply steering force to maintain a constant rate of turn.
							Another critical characteristic of the forklift is its instability. The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying centre of gravity with every movement of the load. A forklift must never negotiate a turn at speed with a raised load, where centrifugal and gravitational forces may combine to cause a disastrous tip-over accident. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift.<br><br>

						<strong><h3>Types of Forklifts –</h3></strong>
							<br>•	Hand pallet truck - no on-board power system of any kind; the operator's muscle power is used to jack-up and move loads.
							<br>•	Walkie low lift truck- powered pallet truck, usually electrically powered
							<br>•	Rider low lift truck - usually electrically powered
							<br>•	Towing tractor - may be internal combustion engine or electrically powered
							<br>•	Walkie stacker - usually electrically powered
							<br>•	Rider stacker- usually electrically powered
							<br>•	Reach truck - variant on a Rider Stacker forklift, designed for small aisles, usually Electrically Powered, named because the forks<p>

							<br><strong><h2>Journal –</h2></strong>
							<strong><h2>Week 1:</h2></strong><br>
							<p>This week I was given the design brief for the forklift project. I did some research on what a forklift is and how they work. I looked at the different types of forklifts and what they are generally used for. I went to the
								<a href ="https://www.scorpiotechnology.com.au/"> scorpio technology </a> website to look at what types of electric motor we would be using to create our forklift. I learned that we are using the MOT17 to drive and raise/lower the forks.</p><br>
								<strong><h2> Week 2: </h2></strong><br>
								<p>I took photos of the parts I had been given in the kit and researched the mechanical specifications of the MOT17 (electric motor). Took a brief look through the
									<a href="Forklift.pdf">instructions</a>. I began assembling the 3 gear boxes by locking down the motor and lining up the plastic gears. Some of the screws were too long and would lock up the motor. Only one of my motors would work with the screws. On one of them I had to glue and the other I put two washers in front of the motor to stop the screws from going through and locking it up.</p><br>
